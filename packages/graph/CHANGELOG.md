### Minor Changes

- 7c66168: Index `docs/architecture/<topic>/ADR-*.md` (the `harness-architecture-advisor` storage convention) as `decision` graph nodes via a new `DecisionIngestor.ingestArchitecture()` method, wired into `KnowledgePipelineRunner.extract()`. Projects whose primary docs are ADRs no longer report empty knowledge extraction. Markdown-style ADRs (no YAML frontmatter — H1 + `**Date:** / **Status:** / **Deciders:**` lines) are parsed; node IDs are namespaced by topic so duplicate ADR numbers across topics coexist. Closes the Finding-3 feature request in issue #504.

  `KnowledgePipelineResult` now exposes `errors: readonly string[]` aggregating BK + decision ingestor failures across the convergence loop; `harness knowledge-pipeline` text output surfaces the new `decisions` extraction count (previously silently omitted) and prints ingestion warnings to stderr — same silent-discard pattern PR #511 closed for `harness ingest`. `harness ingest --all` now also runs `BusinessKnowledgeIngestor`, restoring symmetry with `--source knowledge`.

- aaefe1b: Add `BusinessKnowledgeIngestor.ingestStrategy()` for the Strategic Anchor system (phase 7). Reads a repo-root `STRATEGY.md` and emits one `business_fact` node per non-empty section, tagged with `metadata.domain === 'strategy'` and `metadata.source === 'STRATEGY.md'`. Soft-fails on missing file. Wired into `KnowledgePipelineRunner.extract()` alongside the existing business-knowledge and solutions ingestors. Adds `@harness-engineering/types` as a workspace dependency to pull the strategy contract via type-only imports; runtime section-name constants are inlined locally to preserve the graph → types layer boundary.

### Patch Changes

- 99b5cbf: Fix two silent-failure parsers reported in chat-504:
  - `MermaidParser` no longer drops `.mmd` files whose first non-empty line is a `%%` comment. `detectDiagramType` now skips Mermaid comment lines (matching Mermaid's own grammar) so files starting with provenance headers like `%% Source: docs/foo.md` extract entities normally.
  - `harness ingest --source knowledge` now also runs `BusinessKnowledgeIngestor` against `docs/knowledge/`, `docs/solutions/`, and `STRATEGY.md`. Previously this command only invoked `KnowledgeIngestor`, leaving the business-knowledge substrate reachable only via `harness knowledge-pipeline` and surfacing as a silent `+0 nodes` for users who probed the natural CLI.
  - `harness ingest` CLI output now surfaces `IngestResult.errors[]` to stderr when non-empty, so frontmatter / schema validation failures stop being silently discarded. JSON output is unchanged (errors were already serialized there).

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- d1c9bda: Add `harness check-design` — single-pass design verifier (design-pipeline sub-project #4).

  Mirrors `harness check-docs` exactly. Composes the two design audits shipped in PRs #372 + #390 (audit-component-anatomy + design-craft critique) into one command. Designed to be invoked by the (future) #5 design-pipeline orchestrator inside its convergence fix loop — same pattern harness-docs-pipeline uses to compose check-docs.

  **CLI:**
  - `harness check-design` — runs both verifiers, aggregates findings, persists to graph
  - `--mode fast|full` (default `full`)
  - `--files <glob>...` for scoping
  - Standard `--json`/`--verbose`/`--quiet`
  - Exit codes: 0 = no error-severity findings; 1 = error-severity findings present; 2 = at least one verifier failed (degraded)

  **New exports:**
  - `runDesignCraft` from `packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/design-craft.ts` — programmatic entry point that returns `Result<DesignCraftOutput, ...>` (unwrapped from the MCP response wrapper). Same contract as `handleDesignCraft`.
  - `CraftFindingRecord` type from `@harness-engineering/graph` (was internal to `DesignConstraintAdapter.ts`; needed by check-design to format findings for `recordFindings()`).

  **Verifier-shape convention** (NOT extracted as a formal interface in this PR per the spec's "data points reveal shape" principle):

  Both invoked audits return `{ findings: F[], summary: { bySeverity, byCode, durationMs, ... }, ... }`. `check-design.ts` notes this convention in a top-of-file comment so the next check-\* author follows the pattern. The `Verifier<F>` interface gets extracted when the **third** check-\* command lands.

  **Graceful degradation:** if either verifier throws, the other still runs; failed verifiers surface in `summary.verifiersFailed`; exit code 2 (degraded) instead of crashing.

  **Long-term trajectory** (documented in proposal — not in this PR):
  - v2 = `harness validate` wraps `check-design --fast` internally (one impl, two surfaces)
  - v3 = check-\* commands become facades over graph queries (`harness findings`)

- 0eac8eb: Design-pipeline coordination commits — wire up the Phase 1 vertical-slice MCP tools end-to-end.

  **MCP server registration** — `mcp__harness__audit_anatomy` and `mcp__harness__design_craft` are now registered in `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` / `TOOL_HANDLERS` and discoverable to MCP clients (previously exported but unregistered).

  **`harness.config.json` schema extensions** — adds optional `design.audit.componentAnatomy.*` (gates audit-component-anatomy + the harness-accessibility deferral; controls catalog scoping, fast-mode behavior) and `design.craft.*` (gates harness-design-craft; controls fast/deep mode, autoCapture B' behavior, LLM provider, catalog scoping, signal feedback threshold). All fields optional with sensible defaults; omitting either block uses built-in defaults. Zero impact on existing configs.

  **`DesignConstraintAdapter.recordFindings()`** — generic finding-ingestion entry point that both audit-component-anatomy (ANAT-\*) and harness-design-craft (CRAFT-\*) call to persist findings as graph state. Idempotent (re-running produces no duplicate edges). Per finding: lazy `design_constraint` node creation + `violates_design` edge from file to constraint with per-finding metadata (line, severity, message, evidence, runId). Uses existing graph taxonomy — no NodeType/EdgeType additions.

  **`harness-accessibility` deferral patch** — Phase 1 step 2.6 added: when `design.audit.componentAnatomy.enabled = true` (default), A11Y-010 (interactive without accessible label) and A11Y-050 (input/select/textarea without label) are deferred to audit-component-anatomy for components in its catalog. Same i18n-style deduplication pattern proven in step 2.5. Catalog set loaded via `getCatalogTypes()` from audit-component-anatomy's public export — zero rule-content duplication.

  **Deferred to a follow-up commit:** `harness validate` fast-mode hook for audit-anatomy (the largest individual coordination item; requires touching the validate command path). The other coordination items are surgical extensions that close the loop on Phase 1 without requiring validate changes.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bb7658b: fix(graph/ingest): materialize general Markdown as `document` nodes (#302); consolidate skip-dir usage across walkers and glob excludes

  **`@harness-engineering/graph`:**
  - Issue #302 — `KnowledgeIngestor.ingestAll()` only ran `ingestADRs`, `ingestLearnings`, and `ingestFailures`. Top-level `README.md`/`AGENTS.md` and `docs/**/*.md` (non-ADR) were silently skipped, so no `document` nodes existed and no `documents` edges were created for general docs. The `detect-doc-drift` skill's graph-enhanced traversal was a no-op on any project without a `docs/adr/` directory.
  - New `KnowledgeIngestor.ingestGeneralDocs(projectPath)` materializes `document` nodes for top-level `*.md` (non-recursive) and `docs/**/*.md` (recursive), skipping subdirs owned by sibling ingestors (`docs/adr` → `ingestADRs`, `docs/knowledge` → `BusinessKnowledgeIngestor`, `docs/changes` → `RequirementIngestor`, `docs/solutions` → solutions pipeline). Node id format: `doc:<rel-path>`. Title parsed from the first H1, falling back to the filename. Runs `linkToCode(content, nodeId, 'documents')` so mentioned code symbols get `documents` edges automatically. Wired into `ingestAll()`, so both the MCP `ingest_source` (knowledge|all) handler and the CLI `harness ingest --source knowledge` path benefit without further changes.
  - New `skipDirGlobs(skipDirs?)` helper exported from `@harness-engineering/graph`. Converts a skip-dirs set (default: `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`) into minimatch glob patterns of the form `**/<name>/**`. Use this for tools that exclude via globs (security scan, doc coverage, entropy snapshot) instead of by reading directory names during traversal — the previously hand-maintained `['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**']` mini-lists across packages now derive from the canonical 60+ entry set automatically.
  - Consolidated all hand-rolled skip-dir lists inside the graph package around `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`: `KnowledgeIngestor.findMarkdownFiles`, `BusinessKnowledgeIngestor.findMarkdownFiles` (the byte-identical twin of the #302 bug), `DiagramParser.findDiagramFiles`, `ExtractionRunner.walkSources`. Each picks up the full coverage from #274 (Python `__pycache__`/`.venv`, JS framework caches `.next`/`.turbo`/`.vite`, AI agent sandboxes `.claude`/`.cursor`/`.codex`, etc.) for free, and any future addition to `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` propagates everywhere.

  **`@harness-engineering/core`:**
  - `architecture/collectors/module-size.ts` and `architecture/collectors/dep-depth.ts`: `isSkippedEntry` now combines `name.startsWith('.')` with `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS.has(name)`. Preserves the existing broad dotfile heuristic and adds curated non-dotfile names (`vendor`, `out`, `target`, `build`, `coverage`, etc.).
  - `entropy/detectors/size-budget.ts:dirSize`: skip-set widened from `{node_modules, .git}` to the full `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`. Size budgets now exclude `dist`, `build`, `.turbo`, etc., matching intent.
  - `performance/critical-path.ts`: source-file walker uses `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`.
  - `security/types.ts:DEFAULT_SECURITY_CONFIG.exclude` and `security/config.ts:SecurityConfigSchema.exclude`: default exclude list is now `[...skipDirGlobs(), '**/*.test.ts', '**/fixtures/**']` — file-type/fixture filters preserved, dir-skip portion derives from the canonical set.
  - `ci/check-orchestrator.ts`: same treatment for the two `excludePatterns` defaults (doc-coverage fallback and security-scan ignore fallback).
  - `entropy/snapshot.ts`: `excludePatterns` fallback now derives from `skipDirGlobs()`. Also corrects a latent bug — the previous `'node_modules/**'` (no leading `**/`) only matched top-level `node_modules`, missing nested ones in monorepos.

  **`@harness-engineering/cli`:**
  - `commands/migrate.ts:walk`: skip-set uses `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`.
  - `commands/install.ts`: skill-scan walker combines `startsWith('.')` with `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS.has(name)`.
  - `config/schema.ts:EntropyConfigSchema.excludePatterns`: default is now `[...skipDirGlobs(), '**/*.test.ts']`.

  **Tests:**
  - New `general docs ingestion (issue #302)` block in `packages/graph/tests/ingest/KnowledgeIngestor.test.ts`: 5 cases covering top-level README/AGENTS creation, `documents`-edge linking to mentioned code symbols, ADR non-duplication, ownership-aware subdir skipping (`docs/{adr,knowledge,changes,solutions}`), and `.harness/*.md` exclusion. Revert-and-fail check confirms 3 of the 5 fail without the fix; the remaining 2 guard against future over-ingestion.
  - Updated `packages/cli/tests/commands/install.test.ts` `child_process` mock to use `importOriginal()` partial pattern so transitively-loaded code from `@harness-engineering/graph` resolves correctly.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- fix(ingest, graph): resolve `harness ingest` OOM/recursion crashes (#274) and `loadGraph` V8 string-cap crashes (#276) on real-world monorepos.

  **`@harness-engineering/graph`:**
  - Issue #274 — recursive walker with a 22-entry inline if-chain skip list crashed with `Maximum call stack size exceeded` or heap-OOM on monorepos with populated build caches. The skip list missed `.turbo`, `.vite`, `.cache`, `.docusaurus`, `.wrangler`, `.svelte-kit`, `.parcel-cache`, `storybook-static`, `playwright-report`, `test-results`, `.pytest_cache`, `.pnpm-store`, `.nuxt`, and AI agent sandbox dirs (`.claude`, `.cursor`, `.codex`, `.gemini`, `.aider`). The `.claude/worktrees/` omission alone could multiply walker workload by 50× on heavy users of Claude Code's worktree feature.
  - New shared `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` constant (60+ entries) at `packages/graph/src/ingest/skip-dirs.ts`, exported from the package barrel along with `resolveSkipDirs`. Covers VCS, package managers, JS/TS framework caches, test/coverage outputs, Python virtualenvs and bytecode, JVM build outputs, IDE metadata, and AI agent sandboxes.
  - `CodeIngestor.findSourceFiles` rewritten as an iterative BFS walker — no more recursion, bounded by frontier size rather than path depth.
  - New `CodeIngestorOptions` constructor parameter: `skipDirs` (replace defaults), `additionalSkipDirs` (extend defaults), `excludePatterns` (minimatch globs), `respectGitignore` (default-on, supports the common `.gitignore` subset; negation is dropped silently).
  - Issue #276 — `loadGraph` slurped `graph.json` into one V8 string and crashed with `RangeError: Invalid string length` on graphs > ~512 MB. Production monorepos with thousands of source files hit this easily.
  - On-disk schema bumped v1 → v2: `graph.json` is now NDJSON, one record per line with a `kind` discriminator (`"node"` or `"edge"`). Reader uses `readline` so peak string size is bounded by the largest single record. Old v1 graphs trigger the existing `schema_mismatch` path → automatic rebuild on next scan.
  - New `loadGraphMetadata` helper (exported) reads only `metadata.json`. New `nodesByType` field on `GraphMetadata` enables a fast-path for summary callers that never touch `graph.json`.
  - `RangeError: Invalid string length` now wraps into an actionable error pointing at the offending file and likely cause.

  **`@harness-engineering/cli`:**
  - New `ingest` config block on `HarnessConfigSchema` mirroring `CodeIngestorOptions`. Use `additionalSkipDirs` to extend the comprehensive defaults without replacing them, `excludePatterns` for glob-based exclusions, and `respectGitignore: false` to opt out of `.gitignore` honoring.
  - `harness scan` and `harness ingest --source code` load the `ingest` block via best-effort `loadIngestOptions` — if `harness.config.json` is missing or malformed, falls back to defaults silently.
  - `harness graph status` now reads only `metadata.json` (via `loadGraphMetadata`) and returns instantly with full per-type node breakdown, even on multi-GB graphs that previously failed to load.
  - `harness graph status` reports a clear `schema_mismatch` message instead of an opaque parse error when the graph was written by an older schema version.
  - The CLI's MCP `glob-helper` now imports the shared `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` so the MCP file walker and the graph ingester can no longer drift.

  **Documentation:**
  - `docs/reference/configuration.md` — new `ingest` section documenting `skipDirs`, `additionalSkipDirs`, `excludePatterns`, `respectGitignore`, the comprehensive default list, and a worked example.

  **Tests:**
  - New `packages/graph/tests/ingest/CodeIngestor-skip-dirs.test.ts` — asserts default coverage of `.claude`/`.vite`/`.turbo`/etc., custom `additionalSkipDirs`/`skipDirs`/`excludePatterns` work, `.gitignore` is honored, iterative walker handles deeply nested directories.
  - New `packages/graph/tests/store/Serializer.test.ts` — asserts NDJSON line shape, save/load roundtrip preserves nodes and edges, metadata fast-path returns counts without reading `graph.json`, schema-mismatch on legacy v1 files, large-graph (5K nodes + 5K edges) streams cleanly.
  - Existing `packages/cli/tests/commands/graph.test.ts` updated to assert the v2 NDJSON shape.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 18412eb: Round-trip `metadata.source` through `KnowledgeDocMaterializer` ↔ `BusinessKnowledgeIngestor` so materialized knowledge docs no longer appear as a second "unknown" source contradicting their original extractor. Closes #265.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 3bfe4e4: feat: configurable domain inference for the knowledge pipeline.

  **`@harness-engineering/graph`:**
  - New shared helper `inferDomain(node, options)` at `packages/graph/src/ingest/domain-inference.ts`. Exported from the package barrel along with `DomainInferenceOptions`, `DEFAULT_PATTERNS`, `DEFAULT_BLOCKLIST`.
  - Built-in patterns cover common monorepo conventions: `packages/<dir>`, `apps/<dir>`, `services/<dir>`, `src/<dir>`, `lib/<dir>`.
  - Reserved blocklist prevents misclassification of infrastructure paths: `node_modules`, `.harness`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, `coverage`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `.cache`, `out`, `tmp`.
  - Generic first-segment fallback after blocklist filter; preserves existing `KnowledgeLinker` connector-source branch and the `metadata.domain` highest-precedence behavior.
  - Refinements: code-extension allowlist (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`) so directories with dots in names like `foo.bar/` retain their full segment; symmetric blocklist returns `'unknown'` when a pattern captures a blocklisted segment instead of bleeding into the generic fallback.
  - Wired into `KnowledgeStagingAggregator`, `CoverageScorer`, and `KnowledgeDocMaterializer`. Each gains an optional `inferenceOptions: DomainInferenceOptions = {}` constructor parameter — back-compat preserved for single-arg construction.
  - `KnowledgePipelineRunner` accepts `inferenceOptions` on its per-run options and threads to all four construction sites.
  - Test coverage: 19 unit tests for the helper + 11 wiring/integration tests across consumer classes + 3 end-to-end fixture tests.

  **`@harness-engineering/cli`:**
  - New optional config: `knowledge.domainPatterns: string[]` and `knowledge.domainBlocklist: string[]` on `HarnessConfigSchema`. Pattern format is the literal `prefix/<dir>` (regex `^[\w.-]+\/<dir>$`); blocklist entries are non-empty strings. Both default to `[]` and **extend** the built-in defaults rather than replacing them.
  - `harness knowledge-pipeline` reads both fields via `resolveConfig()` and maps them to the runner's `inferenceOptions.extraPatterns` / `extraBlocklist`.
  - 22 schema validation tests covering valid populated / valid empty / valid absent / invalid pattern / invalid blocklist element / default-propagation cases.

  **Documentation:**
  - `docs/reference/configuration.md` — new `knowledge` section documenting both fields, the built-in defaults, the precedence order, both refinements, and a worked `agents/<dir>` example.
  - `docs/knowledge/graph/node-edge-taxonomy.md` — new "Domain Inference" section with a 6-row precedence-walkthrough table.
  - `agents/skills/claude-code/harness-knowledge-pipeline/SKILL.md` — one-line note in EXTRACT phase pointing at the config override.

  **Known follow-up:** Phase 6 verification showed the real-repo `unknown` bucket did not close as projected on this monorepo (helper + wiring + integration test all pass independently, but the production pipeline runtime path appears to lose `node.path` between extraction and aggregation). The diagnostic is filed as `Diagnose pipeline node-path loss for domain inference` on the roadmap.

  Spec: `docs/changes/knowledge-domain-classifier/proposal.md`. Verification report: `docs/changes/knowledge-domain-classifier/verification/2026-05-03-phase6-report.md`.
