### Minor Changes

- db24d89: fix(lmlm): async model install with WebSocket download progress

  Operator model install (`POST /api/v1/local-models/pool/install`) now returns
  `202 { disposition: 'installing' }` as soon as the pull is accepted and streams
  byte-level download progress plus the terminal outcome over a new
  `local-models:install` WebSocket topic, instead of blocking the HTTP response for
  the entire `ollama pull`.

  This fixes the `502 Orchestrator proxy error: fetch failed (cause: Headers Timeout
Error)` that a multi-GB pull triggered — the dashboard reverse-proxy's undici
  `headersTimeout` (~5 min) fired because no response headers were sent until the
  pull completed. The Recommendations panel now renders a live download progress bar
  and surfaces retryable install errors.

  Approving an `add`/`swap` model **proposal** (`POST /api/v1/proposals/:id/approve`)
  also installs the target, so it shares the same async treatment: it returns `202`
  and streams the download over `local-models:install`, and the Pending Proposals row
  shows the same progress bar instead of hanging the Approve button until the proxy
  times out. (`evict` approvals and rejects stay synchronous.)

  The Recommendations panel also gains a **Refresh** button that triggers a
  force-refresh tick (`POST /api/v1/local-models/refresh`) to recompute
  recommendations on demand and refetch the panel.

  Fixes a refresh-tick ordering bug where the pool was diffed against the ranking
  **before** the re-ranked scores were written back. A freshly-installed member
  enters the pool at `currentScore: 0` until its first re-rank, so diffing first
  produced phantom swap proposals justified as "replace a pool member scoring 0"
  (and inflated `scoreDelta`s). The tick now re-scores the pool before diffing.

### Patch Changes

- f3a4d31: fix(lmlm): distinguish same-model quant rows + stop duplicate swap proposals

  Two "same item" confusions on the Local Models panel:
  - **Recommendations** listed the same `hfRepoId` at two quants (e.g. `Qwen3-32B`
    Q4_K_M @ 21.5 GB and Q8_0 @ 35.1 GB) as visually identical rows because the quant
    was never shown. The row now displays the quant, so the two options read as the
    distinct VRAM/speed trade-offs they are.
  - **Pending proposals** could show the same install target twice (e.g. two
    "Swap in llama3.3:70b" rows for different pool members). The diff engine's dedup
    was per-`(target, replaces)` pair, so across ticks the same model accumulated
    multiple pending proposals — all pulling the same blob. The engine now also
    suppresses a candidate that is already the install target of an **open** proposal
    (rejections stay pair-scoped, since declining one swap of a model does not veto a
    different swap of it).

- 134b055: feat(lmlm): live HuggingFace candidate discovery on startup + Refresh button

  The recommendation candidate list was a bundled, human-curated `candidates.json`
  imported statically at build. The orchestrator now refreshes it **live from
  HuggingFace** — on startup (in the background, non-blocking) and on the operator's
  **Refresh** button — while keeping the frozen list as the offline-safe fallback.
  - New `discoverCandidates()` in `@harness-engineering/local-models` composes the
    existing HF client + GGUF parser and **merges the curated `ollamaName`/`family`
    tags** from the frozen snapshot back in — the HF API doesn't carry them, and a
    candidate without an `ollamaName` isn't installable, so an un-mappable model is
    dropped rather than surfaced as a broken row.
  - The orchestrator seeds the recommender from the frozen list immediately, then
    swaps in live results when discovery returns; `POST /api/v1/local-models/candidates/refresh`
    re-discovers + re-seeds + re-ranks on demand. Fail-closed: any HF error or empty
    result keeps the current candidates.
  - The dashboard **Refresh** button now triggers the live refresh (one button = "get
    the latest").
  - Discovery defaults to a no-op on the `Orchestrator` (so tests make no network
    calls); the CLI's `orchestrator run` wires the real implementation.

  Delivers the `lmlm-live-hf-candidate-discovery` roadmap item. Note: discovery
  refreshes/ranks the **curated** model set — onboarding a brand-new installable
  model still needs its `ollamaName` mapping added (a deliberate curation boundary).

- f3a4d31: fix(lmlm): round numbers on the Local Models panel so raw floats stop leaking

  Disk usage, pool entry sizes/scores, hardware values, and the model-proposal
  justification text rendered raw floats (`75.65831765532494 GB`,
  `score 57.629999999999995`, `18.067657947540283GB VRAM est`). They now follow the
  panel's existing convention via a shared formatter: sizes/VRAM to one decimal,
  absolute scores as whole numbers. The server-side `buildJustification` rounds the
  score and VRAM values it embeds, so the stored proposal summary is clean too.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- bae23ad: feat(lmlm): install & remove models directly from the dashboard panel

  Adds operator-initiated pool mutation to the LMLM dashboard — an **Install**
  action on Recommendations rows and a **Remove** action on Pool-card members — so
  the operator no longer has to hand-edit config or use the CLI.
  - **Backend:** two convenience routes, `POST /api/v1/local-models/pool/install`
    and `POST /api/v1/local-models/pool/remove`, gated by the same
    `manage-proposals` scope as approve/reject. Both are modeled as user-initiated
    **auto-approved model proposals**, reusing the existing `onApproveModelProposal`
    core — so the pool guards (`not_allowed`/`budget_exceeded` → `409`), the
    in-use evict-deferral (`202 deferred`), and the audit trail all apply, and
    proposals remain the single pool-mutation channel (ADR 0011).
  - **Dashboard:** an Install button per recommendation (an already-pooled model
    shows "installed"), a Remove button per pool member (with a "removes after the
    current run" note when the model is in use). Byte-level pull progress over WS
    is a deferred enhancement; install shows an indeterminate "Installing…" state.
  - **Types:** `PoolInstallRequest`, `PoolRemoveRequest`, `PoolMutationDisposition`,
    `PoolMutationResult`.

### Patch Changes

- a9c8994: feat(lmlm): wire pool bounds seed + candidate source so the Local Models cards populate

  Completes the two deferred wiring gaps that left the dashboard's Pool and
  Recommendations cards permanently empty when LMLM is enabled.
  - **Pool bounds seed (Phase 1):** the orchestrator now applies the operator's
    configured `localModels.pool` bounds (disk budget + org/family allowlist) to
    the pool store on startup, after `PoolStateStore.load()` so declarative config
    wins over stale persisted bounds. Previously `PoolManager.configurePool()` had
    no caller and the pool defaulted to `diskBudgetGb: 0`, blocking every install.
  - **Candidate source (Phase 2):** a new `candidates` module in
    `@harness-engineering/local-models` — a GGUF→`RankerCandidate` parser, a
    bundled human-curated frozen candidate snapshot (offline-safe, deterministic),
    and an allowlist-aware selector — feeds the recommender, which was previously
    constructed with an empty candidate list. Live HuggingFace discovery runs in a
    new on-demand `scripts/refresh-model-candidates.mjs` generator (fail-closed),
    never in CI.
  - **Recommendations card formatting:** VRAM and tok/s render to one decimal and
    scores as whole numbers, instead of leaking full float precision (e.g.
    `44.15923222899437 GB` → `44.2 GB`).

- cfc06d2: feat(dashboard): add sidebar icons for the remaining system pages

  `SystemNavItem` now maps icons for `signals`, `tokens`, `webhooks`,
  `insights-cache`, `proposals`, `routing`, and `local-models` (Brain) — pages
  that previously fell back to the default icon. Completes the Local Models panel's
  navigation affordance alongside the install/remove work.

### Minor Changes

- 965cfd3: Add the Local Model Lifecycle Manager dashboard panel at `/s/local-models`: Hardware, Pool, and Recommendations (+ pending model proposals) cards, seeded from the `/api/v1/local-models/*` read routes and kept live via the `local-models:{pool,proposal}` WebSocket topics. Model proposals are approved/rejected through the shared `/api/v1/proposals/:id/{approve,reject}` route. Renders cleanly when the pool is empty, HuggingFace is unreachable, or no hardware is detected (O3).

### Patch Changes

- 0c3d8ed: fix: make `harness graph scan` the canonical graph command and deprecate the top-level aliases

  `scan`/`query`/`ingest` are now canonical under the `graph` group
  (`harness graph scan`, etc.) — the form the post-update hook, fallback hints,
  and docs already reference. All user-facing hints now point at
  `harness graph scan`.

  The bare top-level `harness scan`/`query`/`ingest` commands are retained as
  hidden, deprecated aliases: they still run (so existing scripts, CI jobs, and
  muscle memory keep working) but print a one-line deprecation notice to stderr
  directing users to the `harness graph <op>` form. They will be removed in the
  next major. No command is removed in this release, so the change is
  non-breaking.

- 7abacd5: feat: senior-engineer pre-merge accountability brief (#569)

  Adds a senior-facing "you are pushing X; here's what to look at" surface on PRs.
  - **New package `@harness-engineering/signals`** — the curated repo-health signal
    computation (`gatherSignals`, `signalRegistry`) extracted from the dashboard into
    a shared leaf so any consumer can gather signals fresh without routing through the
    dashboard app. The dashboard now consumes it (internal rewire, behavior unchanged).
  - **New `harness pre-merge-brief` command** — composes the diff summary, the
    `review-ci --json` verdict, a curated Signal-status snapshot, the outcome-eval
    result, and a derived "👀 Worth your eyes" section into a single sticky PR comment
    (upsert by marker). Each input degrades independently to an "unavailable" line;
    never re-runs the review.
  - **New `harness:pre-merge-brief` skill** (tier 2, `on_pr` + `manual`) wrapping the
    command, plus dogfood wiring in `required-review.yml` (non-blocking).

  The acknowledgment merge gate and the adopter CI template are deferred to tracked
  follow-ups. See ADRs 0054 (composer-not-extension) and 0055 (signals shared leaf).

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 863df8f: Phase 4 of the roadmap shard store: route every roadmap writer and content
  reader through `RoadmapStore`.

  In sharded mode (`docs/roadmap.d/` present) each logical mutation now rewrites
  exactly one shard file (conflict-free by construction) and regenerates the
  aggregate; in monolith mode the on-disk `docs/roadmap.md` is byte-for-byte
  unchanged. Every writer captures `before = structuredClone(roadmap)` and
  persists via `applyRoadmapDiff(store, before, after)`, so only the rows that
  actually changed are written.

  Migrated onto the store:
  - `manage_roadmap` (add / update / remove / promote / sync / groom) and the
    show/query readers, preserving the unblock-only cascade, async external sync,
    and first-claim-wins refusal.
  - `autoSyncRoadmap` and `sync-engine` `fullSync` (now takes a project root) with
    per-shard writeback; the assignee-lifecycle invariant holds on every write.
  - Content readers: `prediction-engine`, `publish-analyses`, `sync-analyses`.
  - Dashboard roadmap reader (`gather/roadmap`) and content writers
    (`routes/actions` claim + status).
  - Orchestrator roadmap writers (`/api/roadmap/append` and the
    `RoadmapTrackerAdapter` claim / release / mark-complete), preserving
    compare-and-set, idempotency, and the RMH005 assignee invariant.

  Behavioral note — prediction engine: routing the roadmap read through the store
  also corrected the path it reads from (`<root>/roadmap.md` →
  `<root>/docs/roadmap.md`). Previously `computeSpecImpacts` always failed to load
  and returned no impacts, so spec-impact adjustments were effectively dead; the
  engine now folds spec impacts into the adjusted forecasts (and warning
  severities) as originally designed.

  New core APIs: `RoadmapStore.removeFeature`, `resolveRoadmapStore` /
  `resolveRoadmapStoreForFile` (mode-detection factories), `applyRoadmapDiff`,
  `roadmapAggregatePath`, and a node-fs roadmap IO adapter.

  The read-source guard (invariant R) is tightened to also catch DYNAMIC-path
  readers/writers — code that threads a `roadmapPath`/`roadmapFile` variable into a
  raw filesystem read/write rather than spelling the `roadmap.md` literal — and its
  allowlist has shrunk to its permanent floor (store + regenerator + factory, the
  git/merge tooling, and non-content path references).

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- a4a1d8a: Add a **Work in Flight** kanban board (`/s/kanban`) that surfaces live orchestrator/parallel-coordinator state as kanban lanes — Queued, In Progress, Blocked, and Done. Each in-flight task renders as a card showing its owning agent (backend), worktree path, run-attempt phase, elapsed time, blocker reason, and `blockedBy` dependency chips (cross-highlighted when the blocker is also on the board).

  The board is **read-only and reuses the existing `useOrchestratorSocket` WebSocket snapshot stream — there are zero orchestrator/server changes.** Lane assignment is a pure, unit-tested `deriveLanes(snapshot)` function (`src/client/utils/kanban-lanes.ts`): `running` agents route to In Progress, or to Blocked when their phase is `RateLimitSleeping`/`Stalled`/`Failed`/`TimedOut`; `retryAttempts` carry their error into Blocked; `claimed`-but-not-running ids sit in Queued; and `completed` ids appear as compact Done chips. The client `RunningAgent`/`OrchestratorSnapshot` types were widened with `workspacePath`, `attempt`, `issue.identifier`, `issue.blockedBy`, and `completed` to match the payload `Orchestrator.getSnapshot()` already serializes. Phase coloring and elapsed-time formatting are extracted into a shared `phase-presentation.ts` helper. Complements the retrospective health surfaces and the existing Orchestrator feed view. Adoption #2 (SPECKITTY-2) from the Spec Kitty comparison analysis.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 43f7333: Add a curated five-signal dashboard panel as the default landing view. A new `/s/signals` page (with `/` redirecting to it) renders five signals — `pr-merged-without-multi-persona-review`, `coverage-trend-down-30d`, `complexity-trend-up-30d`, `baseline-auto-update-count`, and `eval-fail-rate` — each with current value, 30-day trend, threshold status, and a sparkline. Backed by a `SignalProvider` registry, a shared `SignalTimelineStore` (hybrid derive-now + cache to `.harness/signals/timeline.json`), and a `GET /api/signals` route that isolates per-signal failures via `Promise.allSettled`. `eval-fail-rate` consumes `harness:outcome-eval` verdicts through the knowledge graph's `execution_outcome` nodes with zero code coupling (documented in ADR 0037). Implements roadmap #534; signals documented in `docs/standard/signals.md`.

### Patch Changes

- 0ca37f4: Upgrade `@hono/node-server` from `^1.19.13` to `^2.0.4`. v2 is a perf-only major (up to 2.3× throughput on body-parsing) with the same public API. The pnpm.overrides floor for `@hono/node-server` is also bumped to `>=2.0.4`. v2 drops Node 18 support (we already require Node ≥22) and removes the Vercel adapter (not used).

### Minor Changes

- dcca2ce: Spec B (Granular Task→Backend Routing): per-skill + per-cognitive-mode routing axes with fallback chains, BackendRouter chain-walk emitting RoutingDecision records, config validator (hard error + warn semantics), dispatch-site wiring with `HARNESS_BACKEND_OVERRIDE` env hint, RoutingDecisionBus with bounded ring buffer, 3 HTTP routes + WS topic `routing:decision`, `harness routing {config,trace,decisions}` CLI + `harness skill run --backend`, dashboard `/routing` panel (4 cards + WS + polling fallback), 5 ADRs (0029-0033). RoutingValue schema widening is additive/non-breaking (scalar form preserves byte-identical pre-Spec-B behavior).

### Patch Changes

- bbc164f: Make harness skills and personas discoverable in Codex CLI, and fix a long-standing scanner false-positive flood.

  **@harness-engineering/cli** (minor): the Codex slash-command adapter now writes to `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with the YAML frontmatter Codex's skill discovery requires; all 50 harness skills are reachable via `$harness-debugging`, `/skills`, and auto-trigger. The agent-definitions adapter emits real Codex subagent TOMLs at `~/.codex/agents/<name>.toml` (12 personas) so they appear in `/agent`. Both surfaces previously wrote dead files Codex ignored.

  **@harness-engineering/core** (patch): `SecurityScanner` now honors `// harness-ignore SEC-XXX: justification` on the line above the flagged code, matching the convention already in use across the repo. Previously only same-line annotations were recognized, so every prior-line annotation silently re-fired the suppressed rule.

  **@harness-engineering/orchestrator** / **@harness-engineering/dashboard** (patch): annotate the previously-flagged `JSON.parse` and `writeFile` sites with the explanatory `// harness-ignore` comments the scanner now reads correctly. No runtime behavior change.

  Also includes an infra fix to `.husky/pre-push` so nvm's Node takes precedence over Homebrew's on PATH (otherwise `better-sqlite3` fails to load under a newer Homebrew Node and blocks every push).

- 16048ad: Bump protobufjs to ^7.6.1, fast-xml-parser to >=5.7.0, ip-address to >=10.1.1 (and other transitive CVE fixes) via `pnpm.overrides` in root package.json.

  Clears 4 high CVEs (all protobufjs code-injection/prototype-pollution/DoS — vulnerable <=7.5.5) and several moderate CVEs that the existing `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `overrides:` block was failing to enforce — pnpm 8.x reads `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` but ignores the same key in workspace.yaml.

  Direct dependency bumps surfaced by the pin: `vite ^6.3.0 -> ^6.4.2` in dashboard, `ws ^8.20.0 -> ^8.21.0` in orchestrator. Both are patch-level upstream fixes (path traversal, uninitialized memory disclosure).

  Updates `auditExceptions` to remove the 8 protobufjs entries that were documented as "blocked by @google/genai → protobufjs ^7.5.4 pin" — the actual constraint is `^7.5.4` (i.e., `>=7.5.4 <8.0.0`), which permits 7.6.1. The rationale was stale. Orchestrator and intelligence test suites pass under protobufjs 7.6.1; @google/genai@1.50.1 has no observable break.

  Audit summary: 19 advisories (4 high, 14 moderate, 1 low) -> 7 advisories (0 high, 6 moderate, 1 low). Remaining moderates are all transitive via vitepress (vite ^5 pin), turbo 2.9.6, or deep transitives (brace-expansion, uuid, qs) — separate effort if pursued.

- c3653ff: Hermes Phase 4: Skill proposal / refinement loop with provenance + soundness gate

  Agent-emitted skill proposals routed through a review queue gated by a
  mechanical soundness check before promotion to the catalog. Closes the
  K1 killer-adoption row from the Hermes adoption meta-spec.

  **New surfaces:**
  - MCP tool `emit_skill_proposal` (tier `standard`) — writes
    `.harness/proposals/<id>.json` and emits `proposal.created`. Emit is
    non-blocking; the soundness gate fires on approve, not on emit.
  - CLI `harness proposals list|show|approve|reject` for queue management
    plus one-shot `harness backfill-skill-provenance` migration that
    stamps `provenance: user-authored` on every pre-Phase-4 catalog skill.
  - Dashboard `/s/proposals` page with inline content, gate findings,
    approve / reject / edit / run-gate actions; reviewer-UX budget < 30s
    per proposal.
  - Seven gateway routes under `/api/v1/proposals/*` (list / get /
    run-gate / approve / reject / edit) — reads use `read-status`,
    mutations require the new `manage-proposals` scope (8th entry in
    `SCOPE_VOCABULARY` and `TokenScopeSchema`).
  - Three lifecycle events (`proposal.created` / `approved` / `rejected`)
    fan out via the Phase 0 webhook bus and Phase 3 notification sinks
    with envelope derivers.
  - Maintenance task `proposal-provenance-backfill` (housekeeping #4,
    Feb 31 cron so the loop never fires automatically).

  **Strict invariants:** `kind` ↔ content shape (new-skill ⇒
  skillYaml+skillMd; refinement ⇒ targetSkill+diff); gate freshness
  < 24h before promotion; refinement edits must diverge from git HEAD
  before approval stamps provenance; provenance enum is closed
  (`community | agent-proposed | user-authored`, expansion requires ADR
  amendment).

  **Skills-mode soundness review degradation:** v1 ships mechanical
  structural checks (kebab-case name, parseable skill.yaml, SKILL.md
  bounds, unified-diff well-formedness). The full
  `harness:soundness-review --mode skill` vocabulary is a follow-up spec;
  both implementations share the same finding shape so the swap is
  purely additive.

  **Test coverage:** 75 new tests across five packages (types schema 15,
  core store + usage 9, MCP tool 8, CLI subcommand 6 + backfill 6,
  orchestrator gate 6 + promote 7 + events 4 + routes 10, envelope
  derivers 4 new rows). Existing scopes test passes with the new
  vocabulary entry.

  ADRs: 0016 (workflow), 0017 (token scope). Knowledge nodes:
  `skill-proposals.md`, `skill-provenance.md`. Spec + plan at
  `docs/changes/hermes-phase-4-skill-proposals/`.

  **Incidental fix:** Replaces a fixed 150ms wait in
  `packages/orchestrator/src/server/webhooks-integration.test.ts` with a
  poll loop. The fixed wait flaked under coverage instrumentation and
  blocked the Phase 4 pre-push hook.

- 38fa742: fix(dashboard,orchestrator): surface `err.cause` in proxy 502s and reject WHATWG bad ports at startup (#287)

  The dashboard proxy was returning opaque `Orchestrator proxy error: fetch failed` 502s for every request when the orchestrator listened on a port the WHATWG fetch spec marks as "bad" (e.g. `10080`, `6000`, `6666`). `curl` does not enforce the bad-ports list, so the port appeared reachable from the shell — turning a one-line config fix into a multi-hour goose chase (see issue #287).

  **`@harness-engineering/core`:**
  - New `shared/port.ts` exports `WHATWG_BAD_PORTS` (frozen canonical list from [the fetch spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#port-blocking)), `isBadPort(port)`, and `assertPortUsable(port, label?)`. `assertPortUsable` throws a clear, actionable error directing the user to choose a different port and linking the spec.

  **`@harness-engineering/dashboard`:**
  - `orchestrator-proxy.ts`: extracted `formatProxyErrorMessage(err)` that surfaces `err.cause.message` / `err.cause.code` alongside the base message. A `fetch failed` from a bad port now reads `Orchestrator proxy error: fetch failed (cause: bad port)`; `ECONNREFUSED`, `ENOTFOUND`, etc. are visible the same way.
  - `getOrchestratorTarget()` logs a one-time `console.error` at resolution time if the configured target port is on the bad-ports list, so the failure mode is announced at startup rather than only per-request.
  - `serve.ts`: calls `assertPortUsable(port, 'dashboard API')` before `serve()` so the dashboard refuses to start on an unreachable port.

  **`@harness-engineering/orchestrator`:**
  - `server/http.ts#start()`: calls `assertPortUsable(this.port, 'orchestrator')` before `httpServer.listen()` so the orchestrator refuses to start on a bad port. The `harness orchestrator start` flow now fails loudly with a clear message instead of starting, appearing healthy to `curl`, and silently breaking every dashboard request.

### Minor Changes

- ed16b44: feat(roadmap): dashboard conflict UX for file-less roadmap mode (Phase 7 — file-less GA blocker)

  Closes the last file-less GA blocker by making HTTP 409 `TRACKER_CONFLICT` responses a first-class, accessible UX surface in the dashboard, and aligning the orchestrator's `roadmap-append` endpoint to emit the same conflict shape as the dashboard's claim endpoints (REV-P4-4, Option A).

  **`@harness-engineering/dashboard`:**
  - New `TrackerConflictBody` type, `isTrackerConflictBody` guard, and exported `CONFLICT_TOAST_TEMPLATE` constant in `src/shared/types.ts`.
  - New Zustand `toastStore` (`src/client/stores/toastStore.ts`) with single-toast supersession via a monotonic `seq` counter so repeat conflicts always re-trigger the refresh effect.
  - New `fetchWithConflict` helper (`src/client/utils/fetchWithConflict.ts`) returning a discriminated-union `{ ok: true, data } | { ok: false, status, conflict?, error? }` so every caller of an endpoint that can emit TRACKER_CONFLICT (S3, S5, S6) dispatches identically.
  - New `scrollToFeatureRow` helper (`src/client/utils/scrollToFeatureRow.ts`): smooth-scrolls the contested row into the viewport, focuses it, and applies a 2-second `data-conflict-highlight` pulse-ring (degraded fallback when the row is no longer in the DOM).
  - New `ConflictToastRegion` component (`src/client/components/ConflictToastRegion.tsx`) with `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-atomic="true"`, and an explicit Dismiss button.
  - `FeatureRow` now exposes `data-external-id="<externalId>"` and `tabIndex={-1}` on its root element so the conflict resolver can locate and focus the contested row without lifting refs.
  - `ClaimConfirmation` recognizes the TRACKER_CONFLICT shape: dispatches a toast event, closes via `onCancel`, and never invokes `onConfirm` on conflict.
  - `Analyze.tsx`'s "Add to roadmap" path is routed through a new `appendToRoadmap` helper that uses `fetchWithConflict`, so an S6 conflict surfaces via the same toast pathway.
  - `Roadmap.tsx` mounts `ConflictToastRegion`, handles the refetch via `GET /api/roadmap` with `cache: 'no-store'`, dispatches the override into a `refreshedData` state, and drives the smooth-scroll-and-focus on the next animation frame; the manual override is cleared on the next SSE `lastUpdated` tick so live updates resume.
  - CSS keyframes fallback for `data-conflict-highlight` ring animation in `index.css`.

  **`@harness-engineering/orchestrator`:**
  - `roadmap-append` (S6) now translates `ConflictError` from `client.create()` into HTTP `409 { error, code: 'TRACKER_CONFLICT', externalId, conflictedWith, refreshHint: 'reload-roadmap' }` (D-P7-A). Previously it emitted a generic 502. This closes REV-P4-4 by giving the dashboard a single uniform conflict shape across S3 (`/api/actions/roadmap/claim`), S5 (`/api/actions/roadmap-status`), and S6 (`/api/roadmap/append`).

  **Documentation:**
  - `docs/knowledge/dashboard/claim-workflow.md` gains a "Conflict UX" section describing the toast, auto-refetch, and scroll-to-row choreography for the file-less branch (step 4).

  **Roadmap status:** With Phase 7 landed, the `tracker-only` roadmap (file-less mode) is feature-complete; manual browser verification of the toast, screen-reader announcement, focus, and pulse-ring is operator-side QA.

### Minor Changes

- 8825aee: Local model fallback (Spec 1)

  `agent.localModel` may now be an array of model names; `LocalModelResolver` probes the configured local backend on a fixed interval and resolves the first available model from the list. Status is broadcast via WebSocket (`local-model:status`) and exposed at `GET /api/v1/local-model/status`. The dashboard surfaces an unhealthy-resolver banner on the Orchestrator page via the `useLocalModelStatus` hook.
  - **`@harness-engineering/types`** — `LocalModelStatus` type; `localModel` widened to `string | string[]`.
  - **`@harness-engineering/orchestrator`** — `LocalModelResolver` (probe lifecycle, idempotent loop, request timeout, overlap guard); `getModel` callback threaded through `LocalBackend` and `PiBackend` so backends read the resolved model at session/turn time instead of from raw config; `createAnalysisProvider` local branch routed through the resolver; `GET /api/v1/local-model/status` route and `local-model:status` WebSocket broadcast.
  - **`@harness-engineering/dashboard`** — `useLocalModelStatus` hook (WebSocket primary, HTTP fallback); `LocalModelBanner` rendered on the Orchestrator page when the resolver reports unhealthy.

- 8825aee: Multi-backend routing (Spec 2)

  The orchestrator now accepts a named `agent.backends` map and a per-use-case `agent.routing` map, replacing the single `agent.backend` / `agent.localBackend` pair. Routable use cases: `default`, four scope tiers (`quick-fix`, `guided-change`, `full-exploration`, `diagnostic`), and two intelligence layers (`intelligence.sel`, `intelligence.pesl`). Multi-local configurations are supported with one `LocalModelResolver` per backend. A single-runner dispatch path replaces the dual-runner split.
  - **`@harness-engineering/types`** — `BackendDef` union (`local` | `pi` | external types), `RoutingConfig`, `NamedLocalModelStatus`.
  - **`@harness-engineering/orchestrator`** — `BackendDefSchema` and `RoutingConfigSchema` (Zod); `migrateAgentConfig` shim for legacy `agent.backend` / `agent.localBackend` (warn-once at startup); `createBackend` factory; `BackendRouter` (use-case → backend resolution with intelligence-layer fallback); `AnalysisProviderFactory` (routed `BackendDef` → `AnalysisProvider`, distinct PESL provider); `OrchestratorBackendFactory` wrapping router + factory + container; `validateWorkflowConfig` SC15 enforcement; `Map<name, LocalModelResolver>` with per-resolver `NamedLocalModelStatus` broadcast; `GET /api/v1/local-models/status` array endpoint (singular `/local-model/status` retained as deprecated alias); `PiBackend` `timeoutMs` plumbed via `AbortController`.
  - **`@harness-engineering/intelligence`** — `IntelligencePipeline` accepts a distinct `peslProvider` so the SEL and PESL layers can resolve to different backends.
  - **`@harness-engineering/dashboard`** — `useLocalModelStatuses` (renamed from singular) consumes `/api/v1/local-models/status` and merges `NamedLocalModelStatus[]` by `backendName`; the Orchestrator page renders one `LocalModelBanner` per unhealthy backend.

  **Deprecation:** `agent.backend` and `agent.localBackend` continue to work via the migration shim, which synthesizes `agent.backends.primary` / `agent.backends.local` plus a `routing` map mirroring `escalation.autoExecute`. Hard removal lands in a follow-up release per ADR 0005.

  - **Identity resolution** — Server-side GitHub identity waterfall (GitHub API → gh CLI → git config) cached for server lifetime, exposed via `GET /api/identity`
  - **Claim endpoint** — `POST /api/actions/roadmap/claim` atomically updates roadmap.md (status, assignee, timestamp), syncs GitHub issue assignment, and returns detected workflow
  - **Assignment history** — Table rendering the assignment history section from roadmap.md
  - **needs-human status** — Full support across gatherer, types, StatsBar, and ProgressChart
  - **Shared utilities** — Extracted `isWorkable`, `detectWorkflow`, `externalIdToUrl`, `EM_DASH` into `roadmap/utils.ts`

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- 69624ba: Fix Neural Uplink chat not rendering messages or responding to skill execution

  **Root causes (3 compounding issues):**
  1. **MessageStream invisible due to zero height** — The Virtuoso virtual list container used `flex-1` but its parent was not a flex container, so the list collapsed to 0px height. Messages existed in state but had no pixels to render into. Fixed by switching to `h-full`.

  2. **First chat turn sent unrecognized sessionId** — The dashboard sent its locally-generated UUID as `sessionId` on every turn. The orchestrator interpreted this as a `--resume` request for a non-existent Claude CLI session, which exited immediately with no output. Fixed by omitting `sessionId` on first turn and capturing the orchestrator's returned session ID via the `onSession` SSE callback for subsequent turns.

  3. **Stale activeSessionId from localStorage** — `handleSkillSelect` checked `activeSessionId` (persisted in localStorage) to decide between creating or updating a session. When the ID pointed to a session no longer in the array, `updateSession` was a silent no-op. Fixed by always creating a fresh session on skill selection, and cleaning up stale IDs on session fetch.

  **Additional improvements:**
  - Added `orchestratorSessionId` field to `ChatSession` for proper multi-turn conversation support
  - Added visible error banner when `/api/chat` stream fails
  - Session fetch now merges server data with locally-created sessions to prevent race conditions
